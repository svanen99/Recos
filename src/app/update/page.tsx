                    <p className="text-justify">

                        As mentioned, I currently collaborate with the owners at our location, which explains the early closing times and no alcohol license. It's not ideal, but to start my dream, I had to agree to these terms. üôè

If anyone knows of a great spot or has connections, <span className="font-semibold text-[#333333]">PLEASE</span> let me know!
