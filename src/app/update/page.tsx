                        Hej everyone! Here‚Äôs a quick update for our loyal supporters.

                    <p className="text-justify">
                        I posted a week ago regarding this issue on IG. So, as you all know, I'm a guy with a dream to open this startup restaurant. The following and feedback has been 
                        <span className="font-extrabold text-[#004aad]"> UNBELIEVABLY supportive</span>, and I love <span className="italic font-semibold text-[#004aad]">EVERYONE</span> that has eaten at my spot! üòä

                    <p className="text-justify">
                        As mentioned, I currently collaborate with the owners at our location, which explains the early closing times and no alcohol license. It's not ideal, but to start my dream, I had to agree to these terms. üôè
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-justify">
                        Now, I'm actively searching for a new location that I can call my own. Ideally, I would like to stay central, but I'm open to a high-traffic area a bit further out. If anyone knows of a great spot or has connections, <span className="font-semibold text-[#004aad]">PLEASE</span> let me know!
